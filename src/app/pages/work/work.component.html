      I’ve been working at Swap, specializing in backend development with Elixir.
      The first two years were through Jaya Tech, and later I joined the company directly
      as a senior engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve worked on systems related to card issuance, logistics, embossing, back-office operations, and more recently, banking.
      My role includes building distributed systems, maintaining services, and collaborating with cross-functional teams using agile practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cloud infrastructure, I manage deployments using Terraform, Kubernetes, and Helm across AWS and GCP.
      I also focus on observability with tools like Datadog, Observe, and OpenTelemetry to ensure system reliability and performance.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the payments space, I’ve contributed to solutions involving PIX, QR Codes, card logistics, and background/parallel processing,
    always aiming to optimize financial operations for scalability and efficiency.

    <p>
      At Jaya Tech, I had the opportunity to work on several projects using different stacks,
      which helped me grow as a developer and quickly adapt to new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first project was with CERC (Central de Recebíveis), where I worked with TypeScript in a microservices architecture.
      I was responsible for maintaining existing services and developing new features,
      gaining hands-on experience with distributed systems and event-driven communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, I joined a team building a payments platform using Clojure.
      This experience introduced me to functional programming in a real-world context and helped me understand how to build
      sustainable systems in a different paradigm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I joined a project at SWAP, still through Jaya, where I became part of the backend team using Elixir.
      This experience was a turning point in my career, starting my journey as an Elixir specialist and diving deeper into building scalable systems
      for the financial sector.
